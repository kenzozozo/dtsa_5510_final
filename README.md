Thanks for checking out my project!

Here you'll find the assets needed to run the notebook.

The fake_news_clf.ipynb notebook contains all of the code and notes needed to make sense of my though process while analyzing and building models for this data set.

The data is found in the "data" folder, which you can inspect as you will. The notebooks will automatically import these files automatically so it shouldn't take a lot to get the notebook running (packages will probably need to be downloaded!)

Thanks again for swinging by!
